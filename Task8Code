# This code uses the boto3 library to connect to the S3 service. Retieve a list of all the buckets in the AWS default region. 
# First the script prompts the user to confirm if he wants to work in the default region, and if the answer is not "yes", the program terminates.
# If the user confirms that he wants to use the default region, the script retrieves a list of all the buckets and display it on the console. 
# The user then have the option to save the result to a textfile by specifying a file name.
